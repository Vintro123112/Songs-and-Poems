<p><br>1<br>Joy to the world, the Lord is come!<br>
Let earth receive her King!<br>
Let every heart prepare Him room,<br>
and heav'n and nature sing,<br>
and heav'n and nature sing,<br>
and heav'n, and heav'n and nature sing.<br>
<br>2<br>Joy to the earth, the Savior reigns!.<br>
Let men their songs employ,.<br>
while fields and floods, rocks, hills, and plains.<br>
repeat the sounding joy,.<br>
repeat the sounding joy,.<br>
repeat, repeat the sounding joy..<br>
<br>3<br>No more let sins and sorrows grow,<br>
nor thorns infest the ground;<br>
He comes to make His blessings flow<br>
far as the curse is found,<br>
far as the curse is found,<br>
far as, far as the curse is found.<br>

<br>Rejoice! Rejoice in the Most High,<br>

While Israel spreads abroad<br>

Like stars that glitter in the sky,<br>

And ever worship God,<br>

And ever worship God,<br>

And ever, and ever worship God.<br>
